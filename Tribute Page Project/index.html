      Smaug was the last great Fire Drake of Middle Earth. Cold Drakes lack the ability of Fire Drakes as they breathe out ice. 
      </p>

      <p>For 170+ years, Smaug had lived under the Lonely Mountain where the vast treasure of the Durin's Folk were. Dragons are <em>very</em> attracted to treasures. </p>
    
      <p>The settlement of the dragons (<em>before Smaug's arrival</em>) drove out the Dwarves, hence pushing Thorin (<em>Dwarf Prince</em>) to come back for revenge to become the rightful <strong>King Under The Mountain.</strong> </p>

      <p>The Company of Thorin employed the help of Bilbo Baggins (<em>a Hobbit</em>) to retrieve the Arkenstone (<em>a.k.a. "The Heart of the Mountain"</em>) because Dragons are too familiar with the scent of Dwarves but a Hobbit's scent might slip by unnoticed.</p>

        <div class="box-2">
      
      <p>If a dragon had smelled the scent of a Dwarf, it would instantly torch the living beard out of one. </p>

     <p> When Bilbo came face to face with Smaug, he tries to distract him with flattery and riddles <em>(pro dragon tip: they love wasting time solving riddles)</em>, but Smaug grew tiresome and decides to burn Lake Town (<em>the nearby village</em>).</p>

      <p>Bard, the bearer of The Black Arrow (<em>the only thing that can pierce the armor of a dragon and send it to its demise</em>) shoots Smaug down and successfully kills the dragon once and for all. </p>
